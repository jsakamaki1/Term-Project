        <h1 id="title">Sweet Basil - Netwon, MA</h1>
        <h3 id="date">December 3, 2019</h3>
        <p>Going to Babson College, there are only so many "good" restaurants located less than a 10 minute drive from
            the school. Sweet Basil has become well known among students at Babson for their delicious food but I
            wantedto try it for myself.</p>
        <p><strong>Ambiance:</strong> It's a dark restaurant with it's black out curtains and dark candlelit vibe. The
            moment you walk in there, all you can smell is their food and your stomach growls. It's a little big crowded
            and it doesn't feel like a "high end" restaurant just from its appearance.</p>
        <p><strong>Food:</strong> When you eat here they have their complementary home made pesto and bread that they
            bring out for you.
            I got to try both their Rosemary Chicken pasta, and their Bolognese. Most of their food is extremely
            garlicky. This place is BYOB, so many people bring their own bottle of wine to drink with their meal.</p>
        <p>Overall, this place is one of my favorite restaurants that's near Babson College. It's just a 10 minute
            drive away. As long as you love pasta and garlic, this restaurant will definitely be a hit with you!
