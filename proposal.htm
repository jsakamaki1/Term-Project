    <h3>What is your webiste about?</h3>
    <p>My website is about food! In Hawaii I’ve been exposed to a lot of different kinds of foods and I always love
        eating out or cooking my own meals. I’m really excited to share restaurant reviews and recipes on my website.
        This site will provide easy at home recipes for people to try and restaurant/food reviews from local places.</p>

    <h3>What is the objective of your website?</h3>
    <p>My objective of my website is to provide easy at home recipes that college students can actually use, but also
        create good meals, and provide a list of restaurants people can go to for specific types of food.</p>

    <h3>Who is your target audience set?</h3>
    <p>My target audience would be people my own age who are interested in cooking more or in need of a new restaurant
        to try out instead of going to the dining hall. This will allow students to read honest reviews of places and
        specific dishes. </p>

    <h3>what content do you plan to include in each page of your website?</h3>
    <p>There will be a home page with links to all the other pages, a page with links to recipes, a page with links to
        restaurant reviews, and an about me page. Each recipe and restaurant review will be its own page on the site.
    </p>
