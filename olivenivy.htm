        <h1 id="title">Olive & Ivy - Scottsdale, AZ</h1>

        <p>
            I had the opportunity to try out Olive and Ivy in Phoenix, Arizona for my birthday dinner! This restaurant
            primariliy service mediteranian/american food. They have a small one sided menu with a few options within
            every "category".
            <br>
            I got to try the Spinach and Veal ravioli. It was so delicious. It came in a lovely bowl, with pieces of
            greens on top. In the ravioli, there was veal, spinach, some type of cheese and raisins for a pop for
            sweetness in this savory dish. It came in a light cream sauce that didn't over power the flavors of the
            ravioli. I really enjoyed this dish.

            For dessert, I had their lemon pudding cake. It was a moist, and almost angel food cake like slice of lemon
            cake. It came with berries, and a scope of their honey ice cream on top of their homemade granola. The honey
            ice cream was one of the best ice creams I've ever had in my entire life (and I consume a lot of ice cream).
            <br>
            Overall, the vibe of this restaurant was very classy, it was right on the water and there was outdoor
            seating. This place didn't have the brightest lighting but it added to the ambiance of the experience. There
            was also a live dj playing music while we were there, it wasn't too loud and it was really popular music. It
            seemed like a perfect place for young adults.
